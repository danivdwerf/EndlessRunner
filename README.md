# EndlessRunner

This project is our first project of the second year on MA.

It is developed by Jonathan Kievits and Dani van der Werf, we did not have any artists, so it might look a bit strange or straight up ugly.

the assignment was just: create an endlessrunner. So we took the obvious streetrunner like game and made it our own.
